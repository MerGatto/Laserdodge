# Laserdodge
Laserdodge is a simple game i am working on.

Features:
 - Gamepad support
 - Fullscreen mode

The Goal of the game is to collect as many stars as possible before the laser gets you.

Watches will give you some time by slowing down the lasers.
Mines will spawn and follow you for some times, if they get you the laser will speed up.
The Speed of the laser also increases over time.
